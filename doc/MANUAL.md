**Note:** the only valid version of the GPL as far as the gencrud
is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.

# 2. Installation

Download the zip file from the version control or use git to obtain the
repository.

## 2.1 Install via .zip

```bash
    pip3 install pytemplate-master.zip
```
## 2.2 Install from source code

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pe2mbs/gencrud.git
```

In your project folder    
```bash
    pip3 install /path/gencrud-source
```

**Note: Python 2.7.x is no longer supported**

# 3. Usage

Standard usage:

```bash
    gencrud [ options ] { <template-file> [ <template-file-n> ] }
                        { [ <template-folder> ] * }

```

`template-file` is the template filename that you want to be processed.

`template-folder` is the template folder that contains the template .yaml files, the

<configuration-file>

## 3.1. Actual usage

```bash
    gencrud examples\role-table.yaml
```

This generates for the role table the frontend and backend code.

```bash
    gencrud examples\role-table.yaml examples\user-table.yaml
```

This generates for the role and user tables the frontend and backend code.

```bash
    gencrud examples/*
```

This generates for all the template files in the folder examples the frontend and
backend code.

## 3.2. Options

The following options

> -h / --help This help information.

> -v Verbose option, prints what the tool is doing.

> -V / --version Print the version of the tool.

> -b / --backup Make backup of the orginal project files files.

When used every file that belongs to the orignal project will be backuped every time its altered.
This is override by the `options.backup` in the template file.

> -o / --overwrite Force overwriting the files.

If this option is omitted the program will exit on encountering a module name that already exists.
This is override by the `options.overwite` in the template file.

> -s / --sslverify Disable the verification of ssl certificate when
> retrieving some external profile data.

When you are behind a proxy that uses it own certificates, you may need to enable this option ones,
to retrieve to extra data files from the nltk package.

> -c / --ignore-case-db-ids Set the database ids in lower case.

This option is for databases that are installed on a Windows server system. As sqlalchemy detectes
the changes in the database model, when using full uppercase columns names, the detection fails.  
This is override by the `options.ignore-case-db-ids` in the template file.

> -M / --use-module Creates a module per object that in included into app.module.ts
> and injects a route into app-routing.module.ts when it exists.

Enables the creation of an Angular module per template. Therefore only the one module is imported in
app.module.ts, instead of at least 4 components. And in app-routing.module.ts the Route is injected
as a single variable instead of all the routes needed to handle the template components.  
This is override by the `options.use-module` in the template file.


> -I / --install Installs the stadard files for the project environment.  

# 4. Requirements

For the default templates there are requirements to the Python and Angular project setup.

## 4.1. Python
The miniman Python version 3.6.x and currently tested upto version 3.10.x
Using the package webapp (version 3.x) provides the standard framework to get a web application with angular running.  

## 4.2. Angular
Current supported and tested are Angular versions 8 and 10, Angular version 12 is under testing.

### 4.2.1. Packages

The following packages are a minimal requirement;

- @angular
- @angular/material
- @angular/flex-layout
- ngx-material-timepicker
  ng-select
- html2canvas
- core-js
- zone.js

# 5. YAML Template

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization
language. It is commonly used for configuration files. See for more information
https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html.

Below an example of a simple template for demonstration purposes.

```yaml
templates:
  python: ./templates/python
  angular: ./templates/angular
  common:
    python: ./templates/common/python
    angular: ./templates/common/angular
source:
  base: ./output
  python: backend
  angular: src/app
objects:
  - name: role
    class: Role
    application: testapp
    uri: /api/role
    menu:
      caption: Database
      icon: database
      access: admin
      before: null | '*'
      after: ...
      menu:
        caption: Roles
        icon: roles
        access: admin
        before: ...
        after: ...
        route: /roles
    table:
      name: WA_ROLES
      columns:
        - field: D_ROLE_ID       INT         AUTO NUMBER  PRIMARY KEY
          label: Identification
          index: 0
          ui:
            type: label
        - field: D_ROLE          CHAR(20)    NOT NULL
          label: Role
          index: 1
          ui:
            type: textbox
```

In the descriptions of the attributes all atttributes are mandatory, unless otherwise stated.

## 5.1. source and templates section

At root level in the file.

```yaml
source:
  python: ./output/backend
  angular: ./output/src/app
templates:
  python: ./gencrud/python
  angular: ./gencrud/angular
  common:
    python: ./gencrud/common/python
    angular: ./gencrud/common/angular
```

When using a template on more than one machine type, ie. Linux and Windows. The `source` tag
needs to be placed in a group of the machine name (all lowercase). Currently the following system
types are supported: `linux`, `windows` and `osx` (as `osx` was nor tested, but assumed that its
unix-like machine, it should work without any problems)

```yaml
windows:
  source:
    base: .\output
    python: backend
    angular: frontend/src/app
  templates:
    python: .\gencrud\python
    angular: .\gencrud\angular
    common:
      python: .\gencrud\common\python
      angular: .\gencrud\common\angular
linux:
  source:
    base: ./output
    python: backend
    angular: frontend/src/app
  templates:
    python: ./gencrud/python
    angular: ./gencrud/angular
    common:
      python: ./gencrud/common/python
      angular: ./gencrud/common/angular
osx:
  source:
    base: ./output
    python: backend
    angular: frontend/src/app
  templates:
    python: ./gencrud/python
    angular: ./gencrud/angular
    common:
      python: ./gencrud/common/python
      angular: ./gencrud/common/angular
```

In the groups `source`, `templates` and `common` the `base` is optional but then the `python` and `angular`
both need to contain the complete absolute path. Both `python` and `angular` are mandatory. For the `source`
group the `python` points to the root folder of the Python backend project. And the `angular` points
to the root folder of the Angular project.

The `templates` group is optional, when omitted the templates that come with the package shall be used.
`python` and `angular` as well as `common` are mandatory. Whenever you need to customize the templates, take a look
at the templates folder in the `gencrud` package (site-packages\gencrud\templates on your platform).
The templates are generated using the Mako template engine, for the syntax of this see https://www.makotemplates.org/

For the folders starting with `~` the user home folder is resolved. Whenever a folder needs to point at
the current folder just use a single dot `.`

In the `source.python` folder there must be the **config.yaml** or **config.json** with the Flask configuration.
The Flask configuration must contain the following keys `COMMON.API_MODULE` with the module name where the code will be generated.

In the `source.angular` folder there must be **angular.json** with the Angular configuration of the project.

## 5.2. Application name (module name)

At root level in the file.

```yaml
application: testapp
```

The `application` contains the same name as in the Flask configuration key `COMMON.API_MODULE` configured.

## 5.2. Version

At root level in the file.

```yaml
version: 1
```

This is an optional element and only version `1` is supported at this time.

## 5.3. Objects

At root level in the file.
`objects` describes the components it shall generate. It contains information aboutsts out how it is presented, the table defintion, the menu entry, and its actions.

```yaml
objects:
  - name: role
    title: User role
    class: Role
    uri: /api/role
    actionWidth: 10%
    actions: ...
    menu: ...
    extra: ...
    table: ...
```

The `name` contains the name of the module that is generated within the namespace of the
`application`.

The `class` contains the name of the class name prefix/suffix used within the Python and
Angular modules.

The `uri` contains REST API of the backend and frontend used for this module.

The `actionWidth` is the css defintion of the column where the action buttons are placed.
The default is `10%`, for most cases this ok, but when using more than 3 buttons, or on a
small screen this may not be large enough. This is an optional element.

The `actions` defines the buttons in the list view module, there are a number of default
actions defined; add, edit and delete. This is an optional element. For more details
see section **5.4 Actions**.

The `menu` describes the menu entry in the frontend of the module. Multiple menu levels
are allowed. See for more details section **5.6 Menu**.

The `table` describes the data table with fields and their presentation properties. See
for more details section **5.7 Table**.

## 5.4 Actions

`actions` defines the actions that should be executed when the user presses an button, icon, row, or cell.

```yaml
actions:
  - name: add
    type: screen
    position: header
    on: click
    color: primary
    label: Add
    icon: add
    route: ...
  - name: edit
    type: screen
    position: row
    on: dblclick
    label: Edit
    route: ...
  - name: delete
    type: dialog
    on: click
    position: cell
    color: primary
    label: Delete
    icon: delete
    function: deleteRecord( i, row, 'D_ROLE' )
  - name: assign
    type: api
    position: cell
    label: Assign
    color: alert
    css: alternate-theme
    on: click
    icon: connect
    uri: /api/role/assign_something
    param:
      id: D_ID
      name: D_ROLE
```

##### name

The `name` is the name of the button, this is internally used and must be unique for the
view. There are three predefined buttons, which may be overriden: add, edit and delete

##### type

The `type` is the result type where the action points to, there are the following options;

- dialog creates a dialog for the action
- screen creates a screen for the action
- list (inoperative at this time)
- api issues an rest API call to the backend
- none disabled the action, this is used to disable the default actions.

##### position

The `position` is the position where a button or action link is placed in the list view.
The position may be one of he following;

- cell Places the button in the last cell of the table row.
- header Places the button in the header of the table view (for add).
- footer Places the button in the footer of the table view (for add).
- row Triggers on the double-click of the row.
- none Disables the action, this is used to disable the default actions.

##### label

The `label` is the caption of the button or an icon-button. It is used as the
tooltip of the icon-button.

##### on

The `on` can be used to alter the behaviour of a action, normally it selects the default
action based on the position parameter; for `row` it is `dblclick` and for the others
it is `click`.

##### color

The `color` can be used to alter color scheme of the button. The color scheme that are available
are the following;

- primary
- accent
- warn

When another color scheme is needed a `mat-palette` and an `angular-material-theme` must be
defined in _styles.scss_. And define the alternate theme there and set theme in the css
attribute of the module.

This is an optional element. When omitted the default is set to _primary_

##### css

The `css` can be used to set a extra css class to the action.
This is an optional element.

##### function

The `function` defines the function that shall be executed in the Angular class. Current
supported function are:

- addRecord()
- editRecord( i, row )
- deleteRecord( i, row [, '<column_name>' ] )

Note that for `editRecord` and `deleteRecord` the parameters `i` and `row` are always
as defined above.

For `deleteRecord` the column_name parameter is optional, when omitted the first column
after the primary key will be used.

To use custom functions a mixin class must be be defined. And with the current version the mixin
class must be added manually to the component. This shall be changed in future version.

`function `is mutually exclusive with `route` or `uri`, therefore optional.

##### route

The `route` describes to navigate to another component, see **5.5 Route** for more details.

`route `is mutually exclusive with `function` or `uri`, therefore optional.

##### uri

The `uri` is used to call the REST API of the backend.

`uri `is mutually exclusive with `route` or `function`, therefore optional.

##### param

The `param` is used to define parameters that need to be passed through the REST API call.

It is a dictionary with a key defining the name of the parameter, and as a value a variable
or a function on the Angular class as used in the .html part of the Angular component.

This is an optional element. And only effective when `uri` is defined.

## 5.5 Route

##### name

`name` is used to construct the route, it consists out of the object's name and
this `name`, therefore you should make sure that the combination is unique. Otherwise
the user land on a different component as you intended.

##### label

This is an optional element.

##### class

`class` is the class name of the Angular component that needs to be activated.

##### module

`module` is that name of the module where the Angular component resides in.

This is an optional element. When omitted it assumes the same module as defined by
`object.name`, it automaticlly selects the source file for screen or table.

##### params

`params` is used to define parameters that need to be passed with the Angular component.

It is a dictionary with a key defining the name of the parameter, and as a value a variable
or function on the Angular class as used in the .html part of the Angular component.

This is an optional element.

## 5.6 Menu

```yaml
menu:
  caption: Administration
  icon: cogs
  index: 0
  menu:
    caption: User roles

```

The `caption` or `displayName` is the caption being used in the frontend presentation.

The `icon` or `iconName` is the icon shown on the left side of the caption.
This is an optional element.

The `index` is a number where in the list, where the menu entry initial should be placed.
This is an optional element. When ommitted the menu entry will be added to the end of the menu.

The `menu` is a child of the menu item its placed in. The number of levels is unlimited,
but its recommended not to exceed 3 levels.
This is an optional element, but when ommitted the `route` element should be present.

The `route` defines the route for the frontend, each route must be unique. It always starts
with a forward slash `/`.
This is an optional element, but when ommitted the `menu` element should be present.

## 5.7 Table

information see section **5.9 dialogtabs & screentabs**.
This is are optional elements.

##### order-by

`order-by` defines one or more indexes, by the field name. The index name is automatically
generated. This is superseeded by `column.uniqueKey`.
This is an optional element.

##### viewSort

'viewSort' defines the default sorting of the table view, it needs two attributes;

- field
- direction
  'viewSort' is an optional element.

`field` defines the column name (by the database column name) where the default sorting will
be based on.

`direction` defines the sorting order, i.e. asc (ascending) or desc (decending).

##### columns

`format` is used to format the `pipe`, `date`, `time` or `datetime` controls. `format` may consist
out of two element seperated by a semicolon `;` first part (optional) the locale for the field. The
locale is used for setting the correct timezone of the field. The second part is the formatting of
the repersentation of the field.

This is an optional element.

##### service

`service` defines a service call to another component to retrieve a list of values and labels that are used for the
**choice** and **combobox** controls.

```yaml
service:
  name: tr
  class: TestRun
  path: ../tr/service
  value: TR_ID
  label: TR_FULL_NAME
```

`service` has the following attributes;

- name: defines the module name where the service resides in
- class: defines the base name of the class
- path: defines path and name where the Angular service is defined
- value: defines the field name from the table which is used as the value that is stored in the current table
- label: defined the field name from the table which is shown in the **choice** or **combobox** control

`service` and `resolve-list` are mutually exclusive. This is an optional element.

##### resolve-list

`resolve-list` defines a list of labels and values that are used for the **choice** and **combobox** controls.

```yaml
resolve-list:
  - label: "Pending"
    value: 0
  - label: "Warning"
    value: 1
  - label: "Manual"
    value: 2
  - label: "Passed"
    value: 3
```

`resolve-list` is a list with the following attributes;

- value: defines the field name from the table which is used as the value that is stored in the current table
- label: defines the field name from the table which is shown in the **choice** or **combobox** control

`service` and `resolve-list` are mutually exclusive. This is an optional element.

`resolve-list` has a simpler format where the value is the key of the `resolve-list` and the value of that key
is the value.

```yaml
resolve-list:
  0: "Pending"
  1: "Warning"
  2: "Manual"
  3: "Passed"
```

##### constant-format

`constant-format` is an expression to format the constant variable with the values in the _constant.py_ file.
By default the label from the `resolve-list` is used as the constant variable name and the value from the
`resolve-list` is used without any formating. This means that in cases where the same label is defined, only
the first occurrence shall be in the _constant.py_ file. To avoid this the template writer must make the
constant names unique. This can be done with `constant-format` expression, there are the following variables
available;

- table: table name as defined object -> table -> name
- field: field name as defined object -> column -> field (only the name)
- label: label from the resolve-list
- value: value from the resolve-list

The following simple example creates a constant name preceeded by the field name.

```yaml
constant-format: "'{0} = {1}'.format( '_'.join( [ field, label.upper() ] ), value )"
```

**Note:** The `constant-format` is an actual Python expression. When an error is detected the traceback
is shown to resolve the error.

**Note:** The internal of gencrud norimaizes the attributes (table, field, label), this means that when it
starts with a digit, an underscore `_` is prepended to the attribute, where other characters are used than
letters and digits, then those are replaced with a single underscore `_`.

##### rows

`rows` defines the number of rows that are shown for the **textarea** control. This is an optional element.

##### cols

`cols` defines the number of columns that are shown for the **textarea** control. This is an optional element.

## 5.10 dialogtabs & screentabs

```yaml
dialogtabs:
  labels:
    - Remark
    - Users
  grouptag: mat-tab-group
  tabtag: mat-tab
  contenttag: mat-card
  tab:
    - label: Users
      component: app-user-table
      params:
        id: "D_ROLE_ID"
        value: D_ROLE_ID
        mode: "filter"
```

`dialogtabs` and `screentabs` have the same attributes, when the action defines a dialog the `dialogtabs` shall
be used for contructing the tabs or for screen the `screentabs` shall be used.

##### labels

`labels` defines a list of tab captions, the caption of a tab is also used to link a field to a specific tab.  
The order of the list is the order of the tabs on the screen or dialog.

##### grouptag

`grouptag` defines the HTML selector of the Material design tab-group component with supports for basic tab
pairs (label + content)
This is an optional element. When omitted the default used is 'mat-tab-group'

##### tabtag

`tabtag` defines the HTML selector of the Material tab component, where the content of the tab is placed in.
This is an optional element. When omitted the default used is 'mat-tab'

##### contenttag

`contenttag` defines an extra HTML selector panel within the tab.
This is an optional element. When omitted none is used.

##### tab

`tab` defines an actual tab with an component, on this tab only the defined component shall be available, no
fields from the current table are allowed. This is an optional element.

`tab` have de following attributes;

- label: the tab label name to insert the component into
- component: the HTML selector of the component
- params: this is a optioal dictionary containing the attributes with values to be injected into the component

## 5.11 Options

At root level in the file. This is available from gencrud version 1.6.366.

```yaml
options:
  use-module: false
  overwrite: false
  backup: false
  ignore-case-db-ids: false
  lazy-loading: false
```

This is an optional element. When omitted the default for the options is _false_  
When an option is included it supersedes the command line option.

- `use-module` enables the creation of an Angular module per template.

- `overwrite` enables the overwriting of the files in the target folder. When overwrite is _false_,
  no files shall be written if they exist, even when they are changed.

- `backup` makes backups of all the files it overwrites.

- `case-insensitive-db-ids` all database names shall be in lower case.

- `lazy-loading` this option is only effective when `use-module` is enabled. When enabled
  the module is added as a lazy loaded module instead of direct loaded.

## 5.12 Extra

At the root level in the file. This is available from gencrud version 1.7.367. This is only required when `use-module`
is set to **true**.
With `extra` imports to the TypeScript components can be made. As the TypeScript compiler cannot find components
that are defined in other shared modules, it is nessarry to import those components or modules for a specific
directive, service, or component.

```yaml
extra:
  imports: ...
```

`imports` see for more details **5.12.1 Imports**.

### 5.12.1 Imports

`imports` is a list of modules or components that needs to be imported within the module.

```yaml
- module: RoleModule
  path: ./role.module
  where: module
  type: typescript
- component: StandardComponent
  path: ./role.module
  where: module
  type: typescript
- module: SomeModule
  path: ./modules/some.module
  where: app
  type: typescript
```

- `module` is the module class name to be imported.
- `component` is the component class name to be imported.
- `path` is the path including the filename where the module or component is defined in.
- `where` is where the import must take place, there are two options:

- _module_: the current module that is being generated
- _app_: the main application module **app.module.ts**

When `where` is omitted the default is _module_

`type` type if import, there are two type of imports;

- _typescript_: the import is intended for the typescript module
- _python_: the import is intended for the python module

When `where` is omitted the default is _typescript_

## references
